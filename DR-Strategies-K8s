DR Strategies for Kubernetes

Mix of mission critical vs business critical vs 
non critical

Has to be container granular
Has to be namespace granular 

Need to understand how your application 
needs to be backed up.
Different for Mysql, for cassandra
for mongodb for ElasticSearch for Kafka

Also needs to backup the application configuration
as well as data 
Appconfig [ things like PV, PVC, controllers, ]

Round trip latency < 10 ms 
Between two deployment sites ( be it AWS or Azure)

Every write is replicated to standby 
Objects are also replicated
Any time they are deployed or 
updated

Snapshots of data and moving it over
Async replication
