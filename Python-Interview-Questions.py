Difference between tuples and list 
- list are mutable and tuples are immutable

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5)
my_tuple[2]=6
#Throws error

my_list=[1,2,3,4,5]
my_list[3]=54
#This will work

Tuples are more memory efficient than lists

Why is Python?
It is interpreted line by line.
Which means that it is first compiled
and then that code is executed line by line

So, the difference between interpreted and compiled languages is 
not only about the output format, but also about how the code is 
executed. Java is considered a compiled language because the 
code is transformed into an intermediate format that is executed 
by the JVM, whereas Python is considered an interpreted
language because the code is executed directly by the 
interpreter.

How does memory management occurs in Python.
It is controlled by the Python runtime[Python memory manager].
Whenever there is an object created by a program , the python memory 
manager keeps a count of the reference count.
The reference count is incremented to 1, and as you create more and more reference
the reference counter for the object is incremented.

Eg. a=[1,2,3]
//object a created and reference count set to 1

c=a
//Another reference created, so reference count incremented to 2

del c
//Reference count decremented by 1

At the end, when the reference count decreases to 0,
then Python garbage collector will deallocate the 
memory allocated to the object 
===
In Python, memory management is handled by the Python Memory Manager, which is a component of the Python runtime system. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for the Python objects used by the program.

Python uses a system of reference counting to keep track of the number of references to an object. When an object is created, its reference count is set to one. When a new reference to the object is created, the reference count is incremented, and when a reference to the object is deleted, the reference count is decremented.

When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the memory manager automatically deallocates the memory used by the object. This process is called garbage collection.

Python also has a built-in garbage collector, which periodically checks for objects in memory that are no longer referenced by the program. These objects are then deallocated to free up memory.

In addition to reference counting and garbage collection, Python also uses a technique called "object pooling" to improve memory management. Object pooling is a technique where frequently used objects are kept in a pool so that they can be reused without having to be recreated. This can improve performance by reducing the number of objects that need to be created and deallocated.

Python also uses a technique called "compacting" to reduce the amount of memory fragmentation. This is the process of moving objects around in memory to reduce the amount of free memory that is scattered throughout the heap.

In summary, Python uses a system of reference counting, garbage collection, object pooling and compacting to manage memory efficiently. The Python Memory Manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for the Python objects used by the program. The garbage collector periodically checks for objects that are no longer referenced by the program and deallocates them to free up memory.




Gaurav Parashar
Can you give me a simple example of reference counting by simple variables
Sure, here's a simple example of reference counting using variables in Python:

Copy code
a = [1, 2, 3]  # a references a list object with a reference count of 1
b = a  # b references the same list object, so the reference count increases to 2
c = a  # c references the same list object, so the reference count increases to 3
del a  # a is deleted, so the reference count decreases to 2
del b  # b is deleted, so the reference count decreases to 1
del c  # c is deleted, so the reference count becomes 0 and the list object is deallocated
In this example, we first create a list object and assign it to the variable a. The reference count of the list object is 1. Then, we create two new variables b and c and assign them to the same list object, so the reference count increases to 2 and 3 respectively.

When we delete the variable a using the del keyword, the reference count decreases to 2. When we delete the variables b and c, the reference count decreases to 1 and 0 respectively. When the reference count reaches 0, the memory occupied by the list object is deallocated by the garbage collector.

It's worth noting that, in the above example we can see the reference count increase and decrease when we create or delete variables, but in reality, the reference counting and garbage collection is done by the Python's memory manager and it's not visible to us as a programmer.




Q:
Is the memory manager and the default garbage collector two separate things?
The Python Memory Manager and the Python Garbage Collector are two separate but closely related components of the Python runtime system.

The Python Memory Manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for the Python objects used by the program. It keeps track of the number of references to an object using reference counting. When an object's reference count drops to zero, the Memory Manager marks it as garbage and makes it available for garbage collection.

The Python Garbage Collector, on the other hand, is responsible for identifying and removing objects in memory that are no longer needed by the program. The Garbage Collector periodically checks for objects that have a reference count of zero and deallocates their memory.

In other words, the memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory for objects and keeping track of the reference count, whereas the garbage collector is responsible for identifying and removing objects that are no longer needed by the program.

It's worth noting that, the Python's default garbage collector uses a technique called reference counting, which is a simple and efficient way to identify garbage objects, but it has its own shortcomings, for example, it can't detect circular references which can lead to memory leaks.


Q: Can you explain the last part of your answer, how does it lead to memory leak
A memory leak occurs when a program holds on to memory that is no longer needed. In Python, a memory leak can occur when an object is no longer needed by the program, but its reference count never reaches zero because there is a circular reference to it.

A circular reference occurs when two or more objects hold references to each other, creating a cycle in the reference graph. This can happen when an object has a reference to another object, and that object has a reference back to the first object. Since the reference count of each object is never zero, the garbage collector is unable to identify these objects as garbage and deallocate them, causing a memory leak.

For example, in the following code, an object of class A holds a reference to an object of class B and vice versa, creating a circular reference:

Copy code
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = B(self)

class B:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

a = A()
In this case, the reference count of the two objects will never reach zero, and the garbage collector will never be able to deallocate them, causing a memory leak.

Python provides a module called gc which allows you to manually run the garbage collector, and also, you can use the weakref module to create weak references to objects, which do not increase the reference count of the object, this can be used to break the circular reference.

In summary, a memory leak occurs when a program holds on to memory that is no longer needed, in Python, a circular reference can cause a memory leak, as the reference count of the object will never reach zero, and the garbage collector will never be able to deallocate them, you can use the gc module and the weakref module to help in preventing memory leaks.

=======
Strip function
It returns a copy of string. 
This when used without passing any arguments will strip the 
left and the right spaces from the string. 

Eg. my_sentence = "    this is my sentence   "
my_sentence.strip()

When passing argument to strip function as character
will remove those characters from left and right 

my_sentence = "this is my sentencet"
>>> my_sentence.strip('t')
'his is my sentence'

>>> my_sentence.strip('this')
' is my sentence'
========
Namespaces in Python

When you use a name in python, it is usually followed in this order

local -> global -> built-in 

local namespace : all names defined within a function or class
global namespace: all names defined within a module 
built-in namespace: All names that are within the builtin modules functions and class

Namespaces are used to prevent naming conflicts between 
different parts of the project.

=====
import math  # math is a built-in module

print(math.pi)  # prints 3.141592653589793

pi = 3.14  # variable pi is defined in the global namespace

def my_function():
    print(math.pi)  # prints 3.141592653589793
    print(pi)  # prints 3.14

my_function()

del math # delete math module from the current namespace

print(math.pi)  # throws NameError because math is not defined in the current namespace

Python Path and its use

The Python Path is an environment variable that tells the Python interpreter where to find the modules and packages that are imported in a program. It is a list of directories, separated by semicolons (on Windows) or colons (on Linux and macOS), that the interpreter looks in to find modules and packages.

When a module or package is imported in a Python program, the interpreter looks for it in the directories listed in the Python Path. If the module or package is not found in any of the directories, the interpreter raises an import error.

The Python Path can be viewed or modified using the sys module. The sys.path variable is a list of strings that represents the current Python Path.

Here's an example of how the Python Path can be used in a program:

Copy code
import sys

print(sys.path)  # prints the current Python Path

sys.path.append("C:\\my_modules")  # adding a new directory to the Python Path

import mymodule  # importing a module from the new directory

print(mymodule.x)  # prints 10
In this example, we first import the sys module and print the current Python Path. Then we use the sys.path.append() method to add a new directory "C:\my_modules" to the Python Path. After that, we import a module mymodule from the new directory and it is able to be imported without any issues because the interpreter looks for it in the new directory which is added to the python path.

It's worth noting that, the Python Path is used by the interpreter to find modules and

Replace() function 
Creates a copy of string , original string is unchanged
replace all occurence of old substring with new substrings

substrings are case sensitive

my_string="gaurav is a good boy gaurav is a good coder"
>>> 
>>> print (my_string)
gaurav is a good bod boy gaurav is a good coder
>>> 
>>> print (my_string.replace("gaurav", "shreya")
... )
shreya is a good bod boy shreya is a good coder
>>> 
>>> print (my_string.replace("gaurav", "shreya", 1))
shreya is a good bod boy gaurav is a good coder
=======
eval and exec functions - Built-in python functions

eval() and exec() are both built-in functions in Python 
that are used to evaluate expressions, but they have some key 
differences.

eval() function is used to evaluate a single expression 
and returns the result. The expression can be any valid 
Python expression, such as a mathematical operation or a 
function call. For example:

===========
x = 5
y = 3
result = eval("x + y")
print(result)  # prints 8
In this example, eval() function is used to 
evaluate the expression x + y and returns the result 8.

On the other hand, exec() function is used to execute 
a block of code and does not return a value. 
It can be used to execute statements 
such as function definitions, class definitions,
 and control flow statements. For example:

Copy code
x = 5
y = 3
exec("result = x + y")
print(result)  # prints 8
In this example, the exec() function is used to execute the statement result = x + y which assigns the value 8 to the variable result and that variable can be accessed outside the exec function.

It's worth noting that, eval() is generally considered to be more dangerous than exec(), as it can execute any expression passed to it, whereas exec() can only execute statements.
Also, eval() can only evaluate a single expression and return a value, while exec() can execute multiple statements and does not return a value.

It is recommended to use exec() instead of eval() whenever possible to avoid the security risks of eval() and only use it when you need to evaluate a single expression.
